When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

ANS:- This can be in the case when multiple people are working on the same project and on the same files.
This can be in the case that one person would be writing the backend code for accessing database and 
making changes to it and other person would be designing the UI for the same. This kind of work will
be more effficient if the files are remote on the server rather than on local systems.
